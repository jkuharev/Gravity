# Gravity

This is a collection of bioinformatics algorithms for time series analysis and classification
	that I originally developed for time warping and feature clustering in context 
	of mass spectrometry based omics data analysis pipeline ISOQuant during my PHD study.
  
The project name "Gravity" results from interaction of mass over time.
